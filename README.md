This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Description

This is a classic game, Tic Tac Toe, built using React. It
keeps track of the history of moves and let's the player(s) time travel backwards and forwards through the moves. The game can be cleared and restarted.

Demo can be found [here https://staceyb.github.io/react-tic-tac-toe/](https://staceyb.github.io/react-tic-tac-toe/)

The coding challenges added included:
1) Printing out the row and column of a move
2) Highlighting the current move
3) Changing the look and feel of the game
4) Determining if the game was a draw
5) Highlighting the winning row with some CSS animation, column or diagonal in the case of a winning game.
6) Adding a restart button
7) Changing board to use flexbox rather than divs and floats
8) Printing out squares dynamically based on the state's array that holds the games values.
9) Added debugging launcher for Visual 
Studio code to make debugging easier
